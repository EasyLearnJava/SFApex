## Welcome to APEX 

## Should we tyecast Trigger.new to get a specific set of objects ?

**Scenario 1:** Trigger.New in Trigger, which works well as it is implicitly type casted to specific object, here is Account.
```
Trigger simpleTrigger on Account (after insert) {
    //works well
    for (Account a : Trigger.new) {
        // Iterate over each Account
    }
}
```

**Scenario 2:** In the Trigger handler class and in a specific method, we are receiving specific list List<Account> as an argument, and trying to loop through the specific object.
```
public class AccountTriggerHandler
{   
    public void onAfterInsert(List<Account> oldList, List<Account> newList)
    {
        //this works fine
        for(Account a:newList)
        {

        }
    }   
}
```

**Scenario 3:** In a method, directly accessing Trigger.new which actually returns list of SObject. So, following code will works well.
```
public class AccountTriggerHandler
{
    public void onAfterInsert()
    {
        //works well
        for(SObject a:Trigger.new)
        {
            if(a instanceOf Account)
            {
                Account accObj = (Account) a;
            }
        }
    }
}
```
    
**Scenario 4:** Type casting Trigger.new to list of Account.
```
public class AccountTriggerHandler
{
    public void onAfterInsert()
    {
        //works well
        for(Account a: (List<Account>)Trigger.new)
        {

        }
    }
}
```
    
**Scenario 5:** Directly accessing Trigger.new without type casting to specific object.
```
public class AccountTriggerHandler
{
    public void onAfterInsert()
    {
        `//will not compile`
        for(Account a: Trigger.new)
        {

        }
    }
}
```    

## Get List of records in SOQL
```
//Using trigger.new directly in IN clause
List<Account> accLst = [select id, name from Account where id in :(Trigger.new)];

//Using Trigger.newMap directly in IN clause    
List<Account> accList = [select id, name from Account where id in :(Trigger.newMap).keyset()];

//Using a custom List in IN Clause
List<Account> accLst = Trigger.new;    
for(Account accRec :accLst){
    if(null != accRec.Business_DUNS_Number__c)
        DunsLst.add(accRec.Business_DUNS_Number__c);
}    
List<Company__c> cLst = [select id, DUNS__c, Account__c from Company__c where DUNS__c in :DUNSLst];    
```
